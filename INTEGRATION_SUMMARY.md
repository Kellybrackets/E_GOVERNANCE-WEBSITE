## Overview
Successfully restructured the Lesotho e-Government platform to move the "Services" section from public navigation into the authenticated user dashboard, enhancing security and personalization.

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Public Navigation Updates
- **Removed Services Link**: Eliminated "Services" from the main public navigation bar
- **Updated ModernLayout Component**: `/components/modern-layout.tsx`
  - Removed Services navigation item (line 77-82)
  - Updated footer navigation to remove service links
  - Maintained clean public navigation: Home, Civic Voice, Explore Lesotho, Help

### 2. Dashboard Navigation System
- **Created Dashboard Layout Component**: `/components/dashboard-layout.tsx`
  - Professional sidebar navigation with user info section
  - Responsive mobile-friendly design
  - Highlighted "Services" as the second menu item with "New" badge

  - Featured services section highlighting National ID and Passport applications
  - Advanced search and filtering by category
  - Professional card-based layout with service details
  - Protected with authentication requirements

### 4. Authentication System
- **Auth Utility**: `/lib/auth.ts`
  - `useAuth` hook for authentication state management
  - `withAuth` HOC for component-level protection
  - `checkAuth` function for service button protection
  - Automatic redirect handling with return URLs

### 5. Protected Routes Implementation
- **Dashboard Pages**: 
  - `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Protected with `withAuth`
  - `/app/dashboard/services/page.tsx` - Protected with `withAuth`
  - `/app/services/national-id/page.tsx` - Protected with `withAuth`

- **Service Buttons**: All service application buttons now use `checkAuth()` function
  - Redirects unauthenticated users to login with return URL
  - Seamless flow back to intended service after login

### 6. Login Page Updates
- **Enhanced Login**: `/app/login/page.tsx`
  - Handles `returnUrl` query parameter
  - Redirects users back to intended destination after login
  - Sets authentication state in localStorage

### 7. Styling & UX Enhancements
- **Global CSS**: `/app/globals.css`
  - Added dashboard-specific animations and transitions
  - Mobile responsive sidebar behavior
  - Professional auth flow styling
  - Enhanced card hover effects

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Route Protection**: All `/dashboard/*` routes require authentication
2. **Service Access Control**: Individual service pages protected
3. **Graceful Redirects**: Unauthenticated users redirected to login with return URL
4. **Local Storage Auth**: Simple authentication state management
5. **Protected Service Buttons**: All "Apply Now" buttons check authentication

## 📱 User Experience

### For Unauthenticated Users:
- Clean public navigation (Home, Civic Voice, Explore Lesotho, Help)
- No access to Services directory
- Clear authentication prompts with professional design
- Guidance to register or sign in

### For Authenticated Users:
- Full dashboard access with sidebar navigation
- Dedicated Services page with search/filter capabilities
- Featured services prominently displayed
- Seamless navigation between dashboard sections
- Professional, government-grade interface

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow:
1. User attempts to access protected route/service
2. `withAuth` HOC or `checkAuth` function verifies authentication
3. If unauthenticated, redirect to `/login?returnUrl={intendedDestination}`
4. After successful login, redirect to original destination
5. Authentication state stored in localStorage

### Navigation Structure:
```
Public Routes:
├── / (Home)
├── /civic-voice
├── /explore-lesotho  
├── /help
├── /login
└── /register

Protected Routes (Require Auth):
├── /dashboard (Main dashboard)
├── /dashboard/services (Services directory)
├── /services/* (Individual service applications)
└── /wallet (Digital wallet)
```
